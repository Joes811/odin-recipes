    <!-- Steps -->

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heart until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.
            Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon of salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons of parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 and 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing
            bowl combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 a teaspoon of salt.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat oven to 190 degree C (375 degrees F)</li>
        <br>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 and 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over the meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheer mixture.
            Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 and 1/2 cups of meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with reamining mozzarella
            and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil, and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>  
    </ol>
